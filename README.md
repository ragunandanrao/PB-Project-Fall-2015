# PB-Project-Fall-2015
This project is for the course Principles of Big Data project for Fall 2015.

The folder contains the code and documentation for the two phases of the project performed as a part of the course Principles of Big Data in the Fall of 2015.
I have also done Twitter Analysis with Apache Spark on Bluemix. The best part of the project is that the entire project has been completed on Bluemix using the various services such as TwitterAnalytics, DashDB, Apache Spark, Object Storage and Ipython Notebooks in Bluemix.
The following is the URL for the Ipython Notebook in Bluemix.
